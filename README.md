# Technica-2021-Project

The following project took place within 24 hours during the 2021 Technica Hackathon. The project was a part of the Two Six Competitive challenge of telling a compelling story given datamined Twitter data. I, alongside my partner, analyzed the data surrounding the distribution of hashtags over time. We won second place in the competition. 

The repository include the original R markdown file, the raw zipped dataset, and the final HTML document with our results that was submitted after the 24 hour marker.
